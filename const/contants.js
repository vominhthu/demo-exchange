            "description": "Launched in 2017, Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project which is fully open source and was built to support the creation of decentralized financial applications (dApps). It claims to have more advanced features than any protocol developed and to have the first currency to evolve out of scientific philosophy, academic theory, and peer-reviewed research. Appropriately, the platform takes its name from Gerolamo Cardano, an Italian polymath who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the Renaissance. \n\n The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is called Ada (ADA), named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron) who is often referred to as the first computer programmer. The currency is integrated natively into Cardano’s settlement layer, making it an essential part of the platform; however, this is something that Cardano reportedly intends to supersede. \n\n Ada enables users to send value over the internet securely and quickly. After launch, Ada had one official wallet called Daedalus. The circulating supply of Ada was 25 billion in 2018, with a maximum potential supply of 45 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Ada offers the ability to stake coins (essentially earn interest on holdings); however, due to the limited number of coins, the block reward is expected to drop over time. \n\n Cardano is spearheaded by three entities, each of which is separately owned and managed. The first is the non-profit Cardano Foundation, an independent body based in Switzerland with core responsibilities to help supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem. The second entity is Input Output HK (IOHK) which is contracted to design and build Cardano. The third is Emurgo, a Japanese incubator acting as the for-profit arm working to boost the Cardano ecosystem through commercial ventures. \n\n Rather than stemming from a whitepaper, Cardano is the result of a number of academic papers. The goal being that considerable peer review efforts via academic partnerships will ensure that Cardano is built and operated using qualitative ‘high assurance code.’ Cardano is being developed using Haskell, a programming language unique to the platform, featuring a high degree of fault tolerance. Smart contracts are created in another functional language called Plutus which enables stricter contracts. \n\n Like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform. It features a unique consensus algorithm (called Ouroboros) that validates transactions without high energy costs, aiming to dramatically increase transactions per second while boosting computational power. The platform is considered ‘third-generation’ and is intended to improve on second-generation platforms like Ethereum and first-generation platforms like Bitcoin. This is partly achieved by employing the ‘Ouroboros proof-of-stake’ model rather than a proof-of-work model. \n\n Both Ethereum and Cardano (or IOHK, the entity that designs and builds Cardano) were co-founded by Charles Hoskinson. Charles is a Colorado-based technology entrepreneur and mathematician who also founded a third cryptocurrency-related start-up – Invictus Innovations. \n\n IOHK’s second founder, Jeremy Wood, was formerly Manager of Operations at Ethereum, which he left to consult various entities on cryptocurrencies before co-founding Input Output. \n\n A key focus of Cardano is to use its coin and technology to provide assistance in countries with an acute lack of access to banking. Cardano has explicitly stated that its currency’s ultimate value will be based upon hard work, real-world use, and the utility of the platform, not on making day traders rich.",

            "description": "Bitcoin (₿) (BTC) is a decentralized virtual digital currency that can be sent between users through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. \n\n The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token). \n\n The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network. \n\n Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. Anyone could download the source code and run it to join the network. Satoshi continued to write the Bitcoin code until 2010 and then handed it over to the open source community. The smallest unit of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi after its founder(s) and represents one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. The first Bitcoin was created when Satoshi mined the first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. \n\n There is said to be a limit of ₿21 million which can be mined. The supply is tightly controlled by an underlying algorithm. So, like gold, there is a limited and finite supply. Unlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, Bitcoin is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. \n\n The managing of transactions and the issuing of Bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source, its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. \n\n Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining, which comprises adding transaction records (or blocks of code) to Bitcoin's public ledger (or chain) of past transactions and keeping them in the queue. Blocks are chopped off as each transaction is finalized, codes deciphered, and Bitcoins passed or exchanged. Miners use special software to solve the math problems that keep the Bitcoin process secure and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in return. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.",

            "description": "Ether (ETH) (Ξ) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform’s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. \n\n Ethereum is made up of nodes run by volunteers across the world, the nodes form what has been described as a ‘world computer’, a decentralized mining network which is not governed by any third parties like, for example, servers and clouds are. \n\n The volunteers, or miners, use their own computational power (gas) to run the network. This involves passing blocks of code between each other and solving the mathematical problems that keep the code secure in exchange for Ether. The currency is listed on exchanges, and can only be used on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas and transaction fees. \n\n Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundreds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. He believed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. When he was unable to gain agreement, he devised a new platform with a more general scripting language. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015.",

            "description": "XRP is the native digital asset of the Ripple platform. Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission. \n\n Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank’s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies. \n\n In 2012, Jed McCaleb, an American programmer and entrepreneur, along with Chris Larsen, an angel investor and startup executive, approached Ryan with a digital currency idea. Jed had been working on a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network. After discussions, Ryan handed over the reins to Jed and Chris, who co-founded the corporation OpenCoin, to develop the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company later changed its name to Ripple Labs. \n\n The Ripple platform is similar to Ethereum in that it has its a native currency (XRP) but is also open-source, allowing users to build their own assets and products on top of the existing platform. Ripple uses its proprietary patented technology, the ‘Ripple protocol consensus algorithm’ (RPCA), to verify transactions. It is argued that XRP is not technically a cryptocurrency because it is controlled by one company and transactions are processed by its network of approved validators. \n\n Ripple released its XRP token in January 2013. Like traditional cryptocurrencies, it is based on a public chain of cryptographic signatures. The company initially set the supply of XRP at 100 billion of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense. \n\n XRP enhances Ripple’s software by acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies, providing liquidity and speeding up cross-border transactions; however, it is not essential to the network and doesn’t have to be used. \n\n RippleNet is what Ripple calls the network of financial institutions using its products. There are three core segments: xCurrent for processing payments, xRapid to source liquidity, and xVia to connect to the network and send payments.",
